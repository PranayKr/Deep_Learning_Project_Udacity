# A Machine Translation Project implemented using Sequence to Sequence Model (having Encoder and Decoder RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks))

Have implemented and trained a sequence to sequence model (having Encoder RNN and Decoder RNN) on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French .
