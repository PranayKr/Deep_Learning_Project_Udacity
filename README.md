# Image Generation Project using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

Have Implemented Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) by making 2 neural networks (Generator Neural Net and Discriminator Neural Net) compete against each other to generate realistic new images of faces . The Neural Networks were trained on CelebA and MNIST datasets
