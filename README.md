# An Image Classification Project using Convolutional Neural Network (Supervised Learning)

Implemented an Image Classification Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by building a convolutional,max pooling,dropout and fully-connected layers to classify images from the CIFAR-10 Dataset which gives predictions on sample images by classifying them correctly
